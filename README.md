# OpenRCT2 Maze Generator



## Installation

1. Download the latest version of the plugin from
   the [Releases page]().
2. To install it, put the downloaded `*.js` file into your `/OpenRCT2/plugin` folder.

- Easiest way to find the OpenRCT2-folder is by launching the OpenRCT2 game, click and hold on the red toolbox in the
  main menu, and select "Open custom content folder".
- Otherwise this folder is commonly found in `C:/Users/<YOUR NAME>/Documents/OpenRCT2/plugin` on Windows.
- If you already had this plugin installed before, you can safely overwrite the old file.

3. Once the file is there, it should show up ingame in the dropdown menu under the map icon.
